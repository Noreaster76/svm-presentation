# How to View the Presentation

## Option 1: Download the PDF
The easiest way to view the slides would be to simply download the file `gjh_svm_presentation.pdf`.

#### Advantages
- As easy as clicking on a link or two
- Platform independent (doesn't require a Mac)
- Free!

#### Disadvantages
- None of the demo videos will work
- You won't be able to see the speaker notes

## Option 2a: Download a ZIP or clone the repository, and then read the markdown
[Downloading a ZIP](https://github.com/Noreaster76/svm-presentation/archive/master.zip) or [cloning the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) will download all the files, including the markdown and the demo videos, to your machine. You could then use your favorite text editor to view the markdown file (`gjh_svm_presentation.md`). Each time you come to a demo video that is referred to from the markdown file, you could simply navigate to that video and play it.

#### Advantages
- Demo videos will work
- Platform independent (doesn't require a Mac)
- You can see the speaker notes
- Free!

#### Disadvantages
- Navigating back and forth between the markdown and the individual videos might be a bit of a pain
- Unless you view the markdown in a markdown viewer, you won't see any of the markdown formatting

## Option 2b: Download a ZIP or clone the repository, and then view the presentation in [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/)
[Downloading a ZIP](https://github.com/Noreaster76/svm-presentation/archive/master.zip) or [cloning the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) will download all the files, including the markdown and the demo videos, to your machine. You then could open the markdown file (`gjh_svm_presentation.md`) in Deckset.

#### Advantages
- Demo videos will work, and you won't have to go through the pain of navigating to each individual one
- You can see the speaker notes (navigate to `View` -> `Rehearse Slideshow`)
- When all is said and done, you have [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/) for future presentations

#### Disadvantages
- Platform dependent - requires a Mac
- You have to pay for [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/) (but it's a great app, saves you lots of time, is well worth the money, and I highly recommend it for creating great-looking presentations quickly)
